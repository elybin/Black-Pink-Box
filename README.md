# The "Black Pink Box" Project
My first Arduino project to controlling 10-channel Relay using MIDI in this case I used Ableton Live 9.

# Background 
Last month I got a challenge to make stunning light/visual show with low budget that can sync with music and visual. The Goal is to controlling lighting such as incandescent bulb, or xmas light (fairy lit) using some MIDI software such as Ableton Live 9, FL Studio or other DAW. After surf the internet, I've found that dis thing can simply be done with just using DMX, but it's so expensive. So I used cheap clone $6 Arduino UNO to solve dis prob.

# Hardware needed
- Arduino UNO
- 8+2 Channel Relay (https://bl.app.link/T9K1deSIsQ)
